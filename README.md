Computer Science Projects




**Project 1: MVC Animator Player: Project Overview**
•	Language: Java
•	Create an animator model, view, and controller using OOP principles.
•	Model takes in txt file, parses it, and outputs an animation.

**Followup:**
•	Created two separate mini game engines and expand on principle.
•	Introduced active input, interaction with objects, switches, and screen movement.


**Project 2: Reinforced Learning for Omok: Project Overview**
•	Language: Python
•	Create an Omok game with a reinforced learning agent and compare it to other AI agents. 
•	Abstract: The project aims to find a winning solution for a game called Gomoku (“Omok”) by using Alpha/Beta (A/B) and Approximate Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. The two separate implementations are then compared against each other in terms of speed, efficiency, and win-rate. The A/B algorithm was ideal to investigate because there are only two players, and each move can be evaluated in simple min or max logic. Meaning that the AI can optimize their strategy, while minimizing their opponents. The second implementation involved approximate RL. This method re lies on an AI agent learning by experience/exploration and creating an optimal policy to follow against the other player. The results revealed that with small board sizes (7X7) A/B agent performed better than the RL agent. However, as the board size increased, the A/B agent struggled with the search space and was outperformed by the RL agent in terms of time efficiency.
